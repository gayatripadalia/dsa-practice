# DSA Practice Repository
This repository contains my daily practice of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and Competitive Programming problems.
I am solving problems topic-wise and uploading my implementations regularly to build strong problem-solving skills.

## Languages Used
- C (current)
- Python (will be added later)

## Folder Structure
01_basics → fundamental programs  
02_arrays_strings → array & string problems  
03_searching_sorting → search & sort algorithms  
04_recursion → recursion & backtracking  
05_linked_list → linked list implementations  
06_stack_queue → stack & queue problems  
07_trees → tree algorithms  
08_graphs → graph algorithms  
09_dynamic_programming → DP problems  

## Goal
- Practice DSA daily
- Improve coding and logic building
- Prepare for placements and competitive programming
- Maintain consistent GitHub contributions

## Update Policy
I try to add at least one problem solution regularly.
